                    <p class="section-introduction__paragraph">John Ronald Reuel Tolkien CBE FRSL (3 January 1892 – 2 September 1973) was an English writer, 
                        poet, philologist, and academic, who is best known as the author of the classic high fantasy works The Hobbit, 
                        The Lord of the Rings, and The Silmarillion.</p>
                    <p class="section-introduction__paragraph">Tolkien's wife was Edith Bratt and they had together 4 children: John Francis, Michael Hilary, Christopher John and
                        Priscilla Anne.</p>
                    <p class="section-introduction__paragraph">After Tolkien's death, his son Christopher published a series of works based on his father's 
                        extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including The Silmarillion. These, together with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings,
                        form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays about a fantasy world called Arda 
                        and Middle-earth within it. Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the term legendarium to the larger part of these writings.</p>

            <h3 class="section-life__heading">Life</h3>
            <p class="section-life__paragraph">John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born on 3 January 1892 in Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State 
                (now Free State Province in South Africa), which was later annexed by the British Empire, to Arthur Reuel Tolkien (1857–1896), 
                an English bank manager, and his wife Mabel, née Suffield (1870–1904). When he was three, he went to England with his mother and brother on what was intended to be a lengthy family visit. 
                His father, however, died in South Africa of rheumatic fever before he could join them.</p>
            <p class="section-life__paragraph">Tolkien learned Esperanto some time before 1909. Around 10 June 1909 he composed 
                "The Book of the Foxrook", a sixteen-page notebook, where the "earliest example of one of his invented alphabets" 
                appears. Short texts in this notebook are written in Esperanto.</p>
            <p class="section-life__paragraph">Edith Bratt and Ronald Tolkien were formally engaged at Birmingham in January 1913, 
                and married at St. Mary Immaculate Roman Catholic Church, Warwick, on 22 March 1916.</p>
            <p class="section-life__paragraph">The Tolkiens had four children: John Francis Reuel Tolkien (17 November 1917 – 22 January 2003), 
                Michael Hilary Reuel Tolkien (22 October 1920 – 27 February 1984), Christopher John Reuel Tolkien (21 November 1924 – 15 
                January 2020) and Priscilla Mary Anne Reuel Tolkien (born 18 June 1929). Tolkien was very devoted to his children and sent 
                them illustrated letters from Father Christmas when they were young.</p>

                    <p class="section-final-years__paragraph">During his life in retirement, from 1959 up to his death in 1973, Tolkien received 
                        steadily increasing public attention and literary fame. In 1961, his friend C. S. Lewis even 
                        nominated him for the Nobel Prize in Literature. The sales of his books were so profitable that he regretted that he had not 
                        chosen early retirement. At first, he wrote enthusiastic answers to readers' enquiries, but he became increasingly unhappy 
                        about the sudden popularity of his books with the 1960s counter-culture movement. In a 1972 letter, he deplored having become a 
                        cult-figure, but admitted that "even the nose of a very modest idol ... cannot remain entirely untickled by the sweet smell of 
                        incense!"</p>
                    <p class="section-final-years__paragraph">Tolkien had the name Lúthien engraved on Edith's tombstone at Wolvercote Cemetery, Oxford. 
                        When Tolkien died 21 months later on 2 September 1973 from a bleeding ulcer and chest infection, at the age of 81,
                        he was buried in the same grave, with Beren added to his name. </p>
